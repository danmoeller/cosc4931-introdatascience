# cosc4931-introdatascience
This is a public repository for COSC/MATH 4931 tutorials, datasets and example code at Marquette University in Spring 2017 

**Jan 17:** introduction to the course and expectations.

**Jan 19:** data intuition and exploration with the classic fisher's iris dataset.

**Jan 24:** we continue our exposition of gaining intuition with our data through exploratory analysis and visualization.

**Jan 26:** Building on our intuition and data exploration, we start unsupervised learning through cluster analysis. Examples shown are k-means, dbscan and affinitypropagation.

**Jan 31:** More exploration of Fisher's iris dataset with multiple clustering approaches e.g. meanshift, spectral clustering etc.

**Feb 2** Introduction to Hadley Wickham's tidy data and tidy verse from theory.

**Feb 7** More exposition of tidy data with code, specifically from: http://r4ds.had.co.nz/wrangle-intro.html

**Feb 9** Guest lecture by Carolyn Olsen from Northwestern Mutual

**Feb 14** Introduction to frequentist and bayesian statistical frameworks

**Feb 16** project topic presentations I

**Feb 23** naive bayes algorithms with mushroom dataset (uploaded)

**Feb 28:** no class, away to cscw

**Mar 2:** heather bort guest lecture

**Mar 7:** introduction to binary logistic regression (R code uploaded)

**Mar 9:** work on mid-term project submission class; project due 11:59 pm.

**Mar 14:** spring break, no class.

**Mar 16:** spring break, no class.

**Mar 21:** how do we report statistical results? 

**Mar 23:** continue discussion on binary logistic regression;
